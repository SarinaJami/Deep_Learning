Image Recognition Problem

Using MNIST dataset, We create four different neural networks and test the accuracy of each model.
We start from traditional fully-connected layers to a more modern approach and witness improvements in the models.

These deep neural networks include:
1. Traditional fully-connected layers
2. Skip Connections
3. Convolutional neural network
4. Batch normalization layer
